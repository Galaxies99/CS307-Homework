\begin{itemize}
  \item (14.1) Consider a file currently consisting of $100$ blocks. Assume that the file-control block (and the index block, in the case of indexed allocation) is already in memory. Calculate how many disk I/O operations are required for contiguous, linked, and indexed (single-level) allocation strategies, if, for one block, the following conditions hold. In the contiguous-allocation case, assume that there is no room to grow at the beginning but there is room to grow at the end. Also assume that the block information to be added is stored in memory.
  \begin{enumerate}[a. ]
  \item The block is added at the beginning.
  \item The block is added in the middle.
  \item The block is added at the end.
  \item The block is removed from the beginning.
  \item The block is removed from the middle.
  \item The block is removed from the end.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{solution}
  Here are the final solutions of different situations.

    Here are the specific explanations. In the following explanation, we ignore the operation to the directory since the directory is stored in memory, not in disk.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method 1: Contiguous-allocation.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Situation 1: Add a block at the beginning.} Since there is no extra space in the beginning, we have to move the data backward. Therefore, we need to start from the last block, read it and write it in the next block. Repeat the process $100$ times, and then we can write the target block at the beginning. Thus, totally we need $100$ reading operations and $100 + 1 = 101$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $100 + 101 = 201$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 2: Add a block in the middle.} We assume that we add a block right after the 50th block. Then we need to move the last $50$ blocks backward, and we also need to start from the last block, read it and write it in the next block. Repeat the process $50$ times, and then we can write the target block in the $51$st block in the middle. Thus, totally we need $50$ reading operations and $50 + 1 = 51$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $50 + 51 = 101$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 3: Add a block at the end.} Since there are extra spaces in the end, we only need to write the target block in the $101$st block at the end. Thus, totally we need $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 4: Remove a block from the beginning.} Since there should be no extra space in the beginning, we have to move the data forward. Therefore, we need to start from the $2$nd block, read it and write it in the previous block. Repeat the process $99$ times. Thus, totally we need $99$ reading operations and $99$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $99 + 99 = 198$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 5: Remove a block from the middle.} We assume that we remove the block right after the $50$th block, that is, the $51$st block. Since there should be no extra space in the beginning, we need to move the last $49$ blocks forward, and we also need to start from the $52$nd block, read it and write it in the previous block. Repeat the process $49$ times. Thus, totally we need $49$ reading operations and $49$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $49 + 49 = 98$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 6: Remove a block from the end.} We only need to change the length in the directory in memory, and we do not even need to change the data in the disk. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $0$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method 2: Linked-allocation.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Situation 1: Add a block at the beginning.} We need to write the new block and update its link to the original first block, which address can be read from the directory in memory. Therefore, totally we need $q$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 2: Add a block in the middle.} We assume that we add a block right after the 50th block. We have to find the $50$th block first by traversing through the links, so we need to perform $49$ read operations before we get to the $50$th block. Then we need to read the data in the $50$th block. We write the data in the target block, and update the data in the $50$th block and write it back to the $50$th block. Thus, totally we need $49 + 1 = 50$ reading operations and $1 + 1 = 2$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $50 + 2 = 52$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 3: Add a block at the end.} We need to write the new block and update the link of the original last block to it, so we need to read the original last block, update the data and write it back to the block. Thus, totally we need $1$ reading operation and $1 + 1 = 2$ writing operations. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1 + 2 = 3$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 4: Remove a block from the beginning.} We need to read the $1$st block so we can get the address of the 2nd block, then we only need to update the directory in memory using the address of $2$nd block. Thus we only need $1$ reading operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 5: Remove a block from the middle.} We assume that we remove the block right after the $50$th block, that is, the $51$st block. We have to find the $51$st block first by traversing through the links, so we need to perform $50$ read operations before we get to the $51$st block. Then we need to read the data in the $51$st block to get the address of the $52$nd block. We update the link in the $50$th block using the address of $52$nd block and then we write it back to the $50$th block. Thus, totally we need $50 + 1 = 51$ reading operations and $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $51 + 1 = 52$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 6: Remove a block from the end.} We need to find the block before the last block, that is, the $99$th block, by traversing through the links, so we need to perform $98$ read operations before we get to the $99$th block. Then we need to read the data of the $99$th block, clean the link in it and write it back to the $99$th block. Then we need to use the address of it to update the directory in memory. Thus, totally we need $98 + 1 = 99$ reading operations and $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $99 + 1 = 100$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method 3: Indexed-allocation.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Situation 1: Add a block at the beginning.} We only need to write the new block and update directory index in the memory. Thus, totally we need $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 2: Add a block in the middle.} We only need to write the new block and update directory index in the memory. Thus, totally we need $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 3: Add a block at the end.} We only need to write the new block and update directory index in the memory. Thus, totally we need $1$ writing operation. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $1$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 4: Remove a block from the beginning.} We only need to delete the target block's number in directory index in the memory, and we do not even need to change the data in the disk. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $0$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 5: Remove a block from the middle.} We only need to delete the target block's number in directory index in the memory, and we do not even need to change the data in the disk. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $0$.
    \item \textbf{Situation 6: Remove a block from the end.} We only need to delete the target block's number in directory index in the memory, and we do not even need to change the data in the disk. Hence, the total disk I/O operation number is $0$.
